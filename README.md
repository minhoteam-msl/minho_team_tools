##MinhoTeam Tools Package

This repository holds the source code for the tool's package of RoboCup MSL's MinhoTeam. The repository will include all the  configuration tools for the robots, using C++ and ROS. This implementation allows an easy interface with the robot's configurations, allowing real-time feedback to any computer that can connect to robot's ROS network.

The package will in future include:

 - [x] Teleoperation of the platform (minho_teleop)
 - [ ] Configuration of Control parameters (control_calib)
 - [x] Configuration of Omnivision parameters (vision_calib)
 - [x] Single-robot visualization debug tool (visualizer)
 - [x] Simplified Multi-robot visualization tool (mini-basestation)
